            It all started when I was 10, I picked up a point and shoot camera for the first time and was intrigued by the fact I could pause time and capture memories with the click of a button! I played with that little camera until my grandparents gave me my first DSLR when I was 13. I spent hours taking photos with that DSLR! I loved getting creative with my images, and getting lost in the beauty of creating things. But once I started high school, I put all my focus on softball and my friends, leading me to set aside my camera. Years later, I took a random photography class and LOVED being behind the camera again. Within a year of taking that class I decided to start a small business, and here I am!<br><br>I'm a 28 year old, born and raised Arizona girl. I've been a part-time respite and habilitation provider for kiddos with special needs for almost 10 years and I LOVE what I do. In 2018, I married my high school sweet-heart, and in 2020 we welcomed our little boy. When I'm not busy being a mom, a caregiver, or a photographer, I spend the remainder of my time with my family and friends.<br><br>I look forward to capturing your milestones and creating memories with you.<br>

XOXO, Lala
